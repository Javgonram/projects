1: create 'simple' sync model with array and object
	notice how accessing changes, what's easier what's harder
2: convert your favorite to use callbacks
	you'll use this for the *book
3: funn extra challenge:  use one of your own custom data strcutures in the model
4: less funn extra challenge:  implement type-validation in your model. (using a settable schema property)
