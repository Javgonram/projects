Project DOM
===

Now that you have your flashy Google or Apple web site clone, it's time to add some functionality to it.

Once you have a solid enough grasp of DOM manipulation, try the following challenges:

+ clicking anywhere on the background, should change the background image or color
+ hovering over the main title should change its size
+ for every link: clicking should trigger an alert stating that you clicked that link
+ try to submit a form. By default the submission is send to the back-end, but in this case you'll need to "hijack" the submission somehow.
+ have a div ( or another block element) dissapear and reappear by clicking a button/hovering over it
  + challenge: add an animation (like fade)
+ challenge: by using only JS clicking on the search button (or whatever is equilavent on the Apple page) should empty the home page and display a page with search results (hard coded).
+ challenge: create a user login form. When a user logs in, his/her/its name should be displayed somewhere in the navbar + the option to log out. The user's login info should somehow be saved in the browser, even after refreshing the page! (hint: look into HTML5 local storage...). Similarly, when a user logs out, the user's login info should be deleted and the navbar should have the option to log in.
+ Challenge: you could use HTML5 GeoLocation to display your current location. This will return geographical coordinates. If you want an even bigger challenge, you could include the Google Maps API to have your current address displaye in human readible form.
