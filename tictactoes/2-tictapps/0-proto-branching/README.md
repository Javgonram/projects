a little folder to illustrate branching without git.  

branching is a workflow concept, git helps but YOU have to do it right
  
Branching is:  
  * working on one independant piece of code at a time
  * ensuring mistakes in one part of the project doesn't break the rest
  * keeping a primary 'clean' project at all times
  
How do you do this?  Empty code like you learned last time is a great way to start.  
  
This folder will simulate git branching using separate files
