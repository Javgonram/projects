# TIC TAC TOE 1 - MVC
This series of mini-projects builds up from a uselessly simple tictactoe board through a full MVC tictactoe implementation.  For each one you are expected to:
1. Read and understand the code provided
2. Write specs for the code
3. replicate the code

Start by reading through folder 0, it gives an example of this process.   
  
At the end of this series you should have a 'perfect repo' with a v-tag for each step and a demo of the final product.
