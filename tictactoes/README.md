# TIC TAC TOES 
The objective of this series is to introduce different app architectures.  
1. simple, pure JS MVC, embedded in HTML
2. replicating the structure of a simple Express project, still front-end only
3. server side rendering (moving DOM manipulation into EJS), and simple Express app
4. controller objects in Express
5. separation of concerns: micro-services file structure
6. building an app from local modules
7. API's
8. single page apps
