This series of projects is to help you understand the difference between frameworks, architecture, and application logic.  
  
every step of cleancalc has you embedding the same exact application logic in a variety of frameworks and architectures.  
  
despite the growth in project complexity, the applications are all the same from a user's point of view.  
  
Each iteration is supporting the same user interactions with the same data.  
  


It is called cleancalc in reference to the CLEAN software archetecture.
